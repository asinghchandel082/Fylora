      <h1>Advanced Free Online PDF Tools - Fast, Private &amp; Ad-Free</h1>
      <p>Fylora offers a comprehensive suite of free online PDF tools. Merge, split, compress, convert, and secure your
        documents instantly without uploads. We prioritize your privacy with 100% client-side processing, ensuring your
        sensitive files never leave your device.</p>

      <h2>Core Features of Our PDF Studio</h2>
      <p>Our platform provides all the essential document utilities you need in one place, completely free and without
        intrusive advertisements. By processing everything locally, we bypass the typical upload bottlenecks found in
        legacy cloud services.</p>

      <h3>Document Manipulation Tools</h3>
      <p>Organize your PDFs with ease. Merge multiple documents into a single file, split large ebooks into smaller
        chapters, and extract specific pages for quick sharing with colleagues or classmates.</p>

      <h4>Merge and Split Operations</h4>
      <p>Combine multiple reports or separate a massive document with our fast and reliable merge and split
        capabilities. It happens instantly in your browser utilizing highly optimized WebAssembly algorithms.</p>

      <h3>File Compression &amp; Conversion</h3>
      <p>Reduce file sizes without losing quality. Compress oversized portfolios for easy email attachments. Convert
        your PDFs to JPGs, extract raw text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), or transform documents
        seamlessly.</p>

      <h4>Optimization Technology</h4>
      <p>Our sophisticated compression algorithms ensure your documents remain crisp and legible while significantly
        reducing their footprint, allowing you to bypass strict email attachment limits.</p>

      <h2>Privacy and Security at Our Core</h2>
      <p>Unlike traditional cloud-based services, Fylora never uploads your files to remote servers. The heavy lifting
        happens locally on your computer, meaning your data is never exposed to external interception.</p>

      <h3>Client-Side Processing Explained</h3>
      <p>By processing everything on your device, we guarantee your data's privacy. No uploads, no downloads, and
        absolutely zero data retention. Your secrets remain yours.</p>

      <h4>Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h4>
      <p>We couldn't read your files even if we wanted to. This makes Fylora the premier choice for handling sensitive
        materials like tax returns, legal contracts, and highly confidential business proposals securely without
        installing dedicated desktop software.</p>
